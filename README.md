# i-love-vue

An example web application built to familiarize myself with:

- the Vue.js framework,
- the Vuex state management framework,
- and Jest/Vue unit test syntax.

Inspired by the mobile app 'I Love Hue',
**i love vue** is a small application that
dynamically generates a matrix of gradient colors,
and then shuffles that gradient on a game board for the
player to arrange correctly.
